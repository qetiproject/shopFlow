## 🧱 Architecture

The application follows a modular and lazy-loaded architecture inspired by clean architecture principles.
Responsibilities are clearly separated between presentation components, business logic services, state management using NgRx and routing with guards. This structure improves scalability, maintainability, and testability.

---

## 🧪 Testing

The application includes comprehensive unit tests covering components, services, and NgRx state management.
Unit tests are written following the **AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) pattern**, ensuring a clear separation of setup, action, and assertion for improved readability and maintainability.

Testing focuses on:
- Component behavior and template interactions
- NgRx actions, reducers and selectors
